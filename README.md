# Classical Cipher Implementations (CIA Assignment)

This repository contains implementations of classical encryption ciphers as part of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) coursework. Each cipher listed below is implemented in Python with simple examples and explanation.

## üîê Implemented Ciphers

| Cipher Name             | Status     | Description |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Caesar Cipher           | ‚úÖ Done     | A shift-based substitution cipher. |
| Atbash Cipher           | ‚úÖ Done     | A reverse-alphabet cipher. |
| August Cipher           | ‚è≥ Pending  | (Description to be added) |
| Affine Cipher           | ‚úÖ Done     | Uses modular arithmetic with multiplication and addition. |
| Vigen√®re Cipher         | ‚úÖ Done     | A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword. |
| Gronsfeld Cipher        | ‚è≥ Pending  | Similar to Vigen√®re but uses digits for the key. |
| Beaufort Cipher         | ‚è≥ Pending  | A reciprocal cipher similar to Vigen√®re. |
| Autoclave/Running Key   | ‚è≥ Pending  | Uses plaintext or external text as key. |
| N-gram Operations       | ‚è≥ Pending  | (To include frequency analysis / attack tools). |
| Hill Cipher             | ‚úÖ Done     | A linear algebra-based cipher using matrix multiplication. |
| Rail Fence Cipher       | ‚úÖ Done     | A transposition cipher using zig-zag writing. |
| Route Cipher            | ‚è≥ Pending  | Transposition cipher that writes plaintext in a grid. |
| Myszkowski Cipher       | ‚è≥ Pending  | Transposition cipher using repeating-key keyword. |

## üß† How to Use

Each cipher is contained in its own Python file for modularity. You can run any script directly using Python:

```bash
python ceasar_cipher.py
