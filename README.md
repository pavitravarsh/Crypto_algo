# Classical Cipher Implementations (CIA Assignment)

This repository contains implementations of classical encryption ciphers as part of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) coursework. Each cipher listed below is implemented in c++ with simple examples and explanation.

## 🔐 Implemented Ciphers

| Cipher Name             | Status     | Description |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Caesar Cipher           | ✅ Done     | A shift-based substitution cipher. |
| Atbash Cipher           | ✅ Done     | A reverse-alphabet cipher. |
| August Cipher           | ✅ Done     | (Description to be added) |
| Affine Cipher           | ✅ Done     | Uses modular arithmetic with multiplication and addition. |
| Vigenère Cipher         | ✅ Done     | A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword. |
| Gronsfeld Cipher        | ✅ Done  | Similar to Vigenère but uses digits for the key. |
| Beaufort Cipher         | ✅ Done  | A reciprocal cipher similar to Vigenère. |
| Autoclave/Running Key   | ✅ Done  | Uses plaintext or external text as key. |
| N-gram Operations       | ✅ Done  | (To include frequency analysis / attack tools). |
| Hill Cipher             | ✅ Done  | A linear algebra-based cipher using matrix multiplication. |
